# CountryMapper
CountryMapper is a mobile responsive app that makes extensive use of APIs to provide geographical information for any country selected by the user. 
It also shows POIs (such as airports, restaurants and hospitals) within the selected country.

Tech stack used includes: HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Leaflet JS library,

## How to Install and Run the Project
This project will need to be run using a PHP-enabled server. I personally used an Apache server to load up the web application.
